Sous Vide Project

This Repository cotains the project "Sous Vide Destruktus" made for EITF11 at **Lund University** (Faculty of Engineering) by me (Wilhelm Bolin), Hugo Tedroff and Nils Johansson

During the course we constructed a fully functioning prototype of a Sous Vide *(also known as an immersion circulator)* based on the **AVR Mega16** microprocessor.

Below is a model of the circuit diagram that was used in the final version of the prototype
